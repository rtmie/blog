The term ["weblog" was coined in 1997](https://www.wired.com/2007/12/blog-advice/), so with just under 20 years of proving I am deeming it safe to dip my toe in the water.

At this rate expect me to have a Facebook page sometime around [2024](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/01/facebook_domain_dispute/).

So hi, I'm Rob and I work as a systems engineer and sometime consultant.
Pull up a chair while I ramble on about Linux, cloud, containers, rawk 'n' roll or whatever comes into my head.
